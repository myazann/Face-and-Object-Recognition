Face Recognition can be used to identify a person, given an anchor photo of him/her. You can give the path for your anchor image in the file. A window pops when the program is ran,
and the calculated distance between your image and the frame captured from your webcam is shown in the middle of the window. A distance smaller than 1.1 means that the people 
in the photos are the same.


I finetuned YOLOv4 to detect custom objects, but the weights are not in Github.
